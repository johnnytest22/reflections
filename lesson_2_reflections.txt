What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, Git adds metadata to your directory that lets it track all the different changes you'll be making from this point forward. Essentially, it initializes the version control process.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working directory in that it acts as a midpoint between the two. In your working directory, you may have made more than one logical change to a file or files and wish to keep them separate when committing to the repository. Having a staging area lets you queue up separate changes for committing.
