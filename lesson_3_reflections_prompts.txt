When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would want to use a remote repository for multiple reasons. The main reason is if all your work is collaborative and you won't be the only person contributing. Another reason is if you'd prefer to store your work on the cloud and not have to worry about local storage.
